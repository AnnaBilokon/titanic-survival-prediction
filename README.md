# Titanic Survival Prediction 🚢

This project uses Logistic Regression to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster.

## 📊 Dataset

- Source: [Kaggle Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)
- Features: Age, Sex, Passenger Class, Fare, Embarked, etc.
- Target: Survived (0 = No, 1 = Yes)

## ⚙️ Steps

1. Data cleaning & preprocessing (handled missing values, encoded categorical variables).
2. Model training with Logistic Regression (scikit-learn).
3. Evaluation using Accuracy
4. Interpreted feature importance (Sex, Pclass, Age were key predictors).

## 📈 Results

## 🚀 How to Run

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
